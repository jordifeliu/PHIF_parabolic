Data used for the paper: Hierarchical Interpolative Factorization Preconditioner for Parabolic Equations

In order to replicate the results, we provide the data used for the diffusion coefficients and initial conditions for both heat equation and reaction diffusion equation
for each mesh size, identified by the suffix NXXX.csv. We also provide the solution u_XXX.csv used for the plots.
