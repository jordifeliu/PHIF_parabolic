Data used for the paper: Hierarchical Interpolative Factorization Preconditioner for Parabolic Equations

In order to replicate the results, we provide the data used for the diffusion coefficients and initial conditions for both heat equation and reaction diffusion equation
for each mesh size, identified by the suffix a_2d_NXXX.csv and u0_2d_NXXX.csv respectively. In particular for N=511,1023 for 2d and N=63,127 for 3d. The rest can be generated as described in the paper.
We also provide the solution u_2d.csv and u_3d.csv used for the plots.
